# Mobility-Network-Data-Analysis-Covid-19

Master thesis for Mathematical Engineering - Modeling and Data Analysis. The work has been conducted under the supervision of Prof. Carla Strada, Simone Formentin and Sergio Savaresi. The aim of the research was to analyze the impact, in three Italian provinces, of the COVID-19 pandemic on private vehicle mobility from a collective and individual point of view through the application of different statistical tools. The dataset was provided by an Italian insurance company that gives its customers the opportunity of opting in a program to have their vehicle constantly monitored by means of on-board tracking devices.
